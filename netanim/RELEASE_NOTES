New user-visible features
-------------------------
- Support for setting the following attributes before simulation and modifying them during simulation:
    a.  P2p Link Description
    b.  Color of the nodes
    c.  Visibility of the nodes
    d.  Description of the nodes (Default is Node ID)
- Built-in support for printing the IP and MAC at the interfaces. Currently if there is a text overlap,  the IP/MAC text will be positioned outside the scene and connected by light blue line, to prevent clutter.
- XML Tags for packet and wpacket now support "p" and "wp" respectively (instead of "packet" and "wpacket"), to save disk-space.

  visible on the scene.
